Under The Hood
- Update panels to reference binding source. May be able to avoid having to use the nested events in ContactModel.
- Input ICON note generator strings into database.
- Add ICON dropdowns to database.
- Utilize database data.
	- Edit Contacts.
		- Service Panels.
		- Symptoms.
		- Outcomes.
		- Equipment.
 - Add Outcomes tooltip.
 - Add status bar to display warnings.
 - Key Command Help extends window height.
 - Symptom Group is irrelevant to Service Views. It's only required in IFMS and is grabbed as the cross section between Service and Symptom.

Short Term:
- IFMS Staple to parent/Clear and Close/Dispatch.
- WOBS scrape appointment data.
- PR Template smart copy.
	- Fills in NBN fields.
	- Extracts CM callback info(For ICON Outcome entry).
	- Extracts Testing Done info(For ICON Action entry.
	- Extracts Outcome info(For ICON Outcome entry).

Long Term:
- Chrome support.
- MAD support. 
	- Create Tester: Popup with Texbox Name, Input, and Application Name fields, pressing OK triggers test.
- ARO GUI.
- Glance GUI.

Potential:
- Realtime KPI's. Smartcopy roster and use call/login information to provide realtime stats.
- Map user interaction with Event Tracking.
- Call statistics. Pull Call history from multiple users and compile call type information.

Considerations
- ITCase Regex is only set to recognize from 2014-2016.
