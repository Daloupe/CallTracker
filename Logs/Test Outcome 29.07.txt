// Outcome ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Bugs:

General
- AffectedService comboboxes didn't work properly after deleting old calls in call history(but not the current one).
| Add field for IT Case
| ICON note generator doesn't work for DTV or MTV or some ONC codes.
| Don't auto create call on open. Disable all fields until user clicks New Call.
- Add Ratecodes to database. Add field for info eg "Doesn't require SO/PG recording codes"
- Perhaps Prefill should paste other data in between each drop down to allow time for page to load (in case WaTin doesn't detect page hasn't finished)

Smart Copy
| ICON account number REGEX needs to split last section off as a group.
- "15 Myrtle gr Preston Vic 3072" Isn't seperating Preston and Vic
| 11567333000153 going to CMBS.
/ Smart copy sometimes doesn't work first time. Focus problem? Send mouse click?
	| Smart paste seems to work first time. Try send ctrl key before the copy command.
	* Alt get window hwnd and send keys directly - Ctrl Up - Ctrl Down - C - Ctrl Up
		* Need to find a way to get HWND for tab.
		* Perhaps if the last ctrl up isn't sent it will allow multiple pastes without lifting the ctrl key.
Smart Paste
| Fault.ProblemStyle gives LIP instead of LAT. ProductCode should be LIP.
| Name Paste not working as not sending Name.Full
/ SmartPasteBind not working when IFMS create first opens - Doing a spb in another page first then works though. Perhaps The saved page variable is confusing it "PreviousWindow/HWND/Title".
	| Remove previoustitle checks.
	* Perhaps use url for previoustitle instead of title. Or intercept all clicks, check for active window title on each.

Gridlinks
/ Gridlinks sometimes doens't find ICON, progress bar sticks at 50% - works after gridlinking another page, so perhaps same issue ie if previosly saved page closes, previoustitle needs to be deleted. Short term fix is to relocate page every time.
	| Remove previoustitle checks.
/ Gridlinks might be causing display issues on IE.
	| Dispose of browser object after every call.
- Gridlinks is still a bit too slow.

IPCC Control
| Transfer option only clickign on top right hand corner of IPPC. Doesn't seem to be adding the offsets.
