	- Extracts CM callback info(For ICON Outcome entry).
	- Extracts Testing Done info(For ICON Action entry.
	- Extracts Outcome info(For ICON Outcome entry).
- Add an Icon to Call Tracker.

Long Term:
- Chrome support.
- MAD support. 
	- Create Tester: Popup with Texbox Name, Input, and Application Name fields, pressing OK triggers test.
- ARO GUI.
- Glance GUI.
- Win-Middle Mouse Button brings up a special menu.
- Auto Minimize?

Potential:
- Realtime KPI's. Smartcopy roster and use call/login information to provide realtime stats.
- Map user interaction with Event Tracking.
- Call statistics. Pull Call history from multiple users and compile call type information.

Considerations
- ITCase Regex is only set to recognize from 2014-2016.
