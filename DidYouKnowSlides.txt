	Data Search
	- Any menu item with this icon indicates it will search that system with the data in the selected field. 
		
Auto Search
- Enable it Here.
- When a field is first filled, Auto Search will inititate a Data Search. It does so silently - It won't bring the searched system to the front. This means when you get around to needing a system, it should already have the customers infomation loaded.
- Each system will only be searched once per call eg if I Smart Copy DN, then the DN is searched in SCAMPS. If I then Smart Copy Username, SCAMPS isn't searched(But UNMT still will!).
- Ignore Active Window will prevent Auto Search from searching in the window you have focussed.
- Open New If None Found tells Wingman to open up a new IE window if you don't already have that system open.

GridLinks Search
	- Uses this Hotkey.
	- Wingman will jump straight to the desired system and perform a search. 
	- Wingman will try and search with the most appropriate data eg If the product is ONC and you have the DN and Username, pressing ctrl-win-3 will search SCAMPS for the username, but if LIP is selected it will use the DN.
